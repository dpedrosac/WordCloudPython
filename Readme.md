The scripts assembled here from other snippets of code are used to create [WordCloud](https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud) from abstract information.

# How to use it?
First install all required packages listed in requirements.txt and create a folder called "data" in your main directory. Then, change the list of PMID in [GetData.py](https://github.com/dpedrosac/WordCloudPython/blob/master/GetData.py) to whatever you want and run the code so that a text-file with all abstracts one line per entry is created. Please make also sure to provide the email adress, which is needed when the [biopython](https://biopython.org/wiki/Packages) package is used. Next, you may want to get rid of stop-words and other special words that may contaminate your list (see [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.html) and [Utils.Helperfunctions](https://github.com/dpedrosac/WordCloudPython/blob/master/Utils.py) for further details.) the options for the WordCloud may be changed according to the [authors](https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud) documentation in [CreateWorldCloud.py](https://github.com/dpedrosac/WordCloudPython/blob/master/CreateWordCloud.py)
